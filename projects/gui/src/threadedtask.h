 * \brief A long task that is executed in its own thread.
 *
 * ThreadedTask is the base class for tasks that can take a long
 * time and should be executed in a separate thread. ThreadedTask
 * automatically creates a progress dialog with a "cancel" button
 * for the task.
 *
 * The ThreadedTask class should be extended by reimplementing
 * QThread::run() and checking for cancellation by calling
 * cancelRequested() periodically. The subclass should also notify
 * the progress dialog by emitting the progressValueChanged() signal.
 *
 * ThreadedTask destroys itself and the progress dialog automatically
 * after the task is finished or cancelled.
